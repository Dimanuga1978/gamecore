// The real, previously-missing "how do I actually run this" entry point.
// Every piece this ties together (ServerHost, createProtocolServer,
// createTokenAuth, createWsServer) already existed and was already
// tested extensively throughout this project's history -- what did NOT
// exist anywhere in this repo was a single script assembling them into
// something an admin could actually start with one command. This is
// that script.
//
// This file contains ZERO references to any specific game, on purpose --
// found and corrected after being asked directly: "the engine shouldn't
// know anything about games at all; games should just plug in." An
// earlier version of this script statically imported five specific
// games and hardcoded a DEFAULT_GAMES registry -- exactly the kind of
// engine-code-that-knows-about-content coupling that principle rules
// out, even though it "only" lived in a reference/example tool rather
// than in packages/* itself. `createTableCoreServer()`'s own `games`
// option defaults to `{}` (empty); nothing is registered unless the
// caller explicitly provides it. The CLI bootstrap at the bottom loads
// a games registry from an EXTERNAL config file (a plain path, read at
// runtime via dynamic import()) instead of importing any game package
// by name -- see loadGamesConfig() below, and
// tools/server/example.config.mjs for a real, working example of such a
// config (which DOES reference this repo's demo games, but lives
// entirely outside this file and is never imported by it automatically).
//
// Two HTTP surfaces, deliberately on separate ports:
//   - the ADMIN API (adminPort): creates/starts matches and issues
//     player/spectator tokens. This is a trust-sensitive surface (anyone
//     who can call it can create matches and mint valid tokens) and is
//     NOT meant to be exposed the same way the game connection is -- in
//     a real deployment this should sit behind your own authentication/
//     reverse-proxy layer, or simply not be reachable from the public
//     internet at all (e.g. only from your own game-lobby/matchmaking
//     backend). Separate ports make it easy to firewall independently
//     rather than accidentally exposing both the same way.
//   - the WS GAME SERVER (port): what players actually connect to with
//     the tokens the admin API issued them.
//
// Structured as an exported `createTableCoreServer()` (options in,
// `{listen, close, host, protocol, auth}` out) plus a thin "run directly"
// CLI bootstrap at the bottom that reads environment variables -- the
// same shape packages/launcher's createLauncherServer() already uses,
// for the same reason: an exported function is directly testable (real
// HTTP requests against a real instance, no need to spawn a child
// process just to exercise the server), while the CLI wrapper is what
// `npm run server` / `node tools/server/start.mjs` actually invokes.

  // renumbering, so a real-but-not-yet-issued relationship between "seat
  // B" and "player B" never has to change) plus whichever unclaimed
