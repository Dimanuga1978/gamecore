  /**
   * Real lifecycle gap this closes: before this method existed, nothing
   * in the engine ever removed a match from `this.matches` -- a match,
   * once created, stayed in memory for the entire lifetime of the
   * process, finished or not. `maxMatches` (see tools/server/start.mjs)
   * only ever stopped NEW matches from being created once that ceiling
   * was hit; it never freed capacity back up from old ones.
   *
   * Deliberately conservative in scope -- removes only:
   *   - a 'finished' or 'aborted' match, once `finishedGraceMs` has
   *     passed since its last real activity (safe: the match is
   *     genuinely, permanently over; the only real loss is the ability
   *     to keep viewing its final board/result after that window).
   *   - a 'lobby' match that was created but never actually started,
   *     once `abandonedLobbyGraceMs` has passed since creation (safe:
   *     nobody ever put real time into it).
   * Deliberately NEVER removes a 'running' match, no matter how idle --
   * "how long is too long for a real game to sit paused" is a genuine
   * product/deployment judgment call (a multi-day async game is
   * legitimate for some deployments, a 10-minute stall might already be
   * "abandoned" for others), not something this shared engine class
   * should silently decide on every consumer's behalf.
   *
   * Pure and deterministic: takes `now` as an explicit parameter rather
   * than reading Date.now() internally, so real elapsed-time behavior is
   * directly testable without waiting on a real clock, and this class
   * itself owns no timer at all -- a real deployment calls this
   * periodically via its own setInterval (matching this project's
   * existing convention of keeping scheduling concerns at the
   * "real server process" layer, e.g. tools/server/start.mjs's own bot-
   * check scheduling, not inside the engine's core, timer-free classes).
   * Returns the list of {id, reason} removed, for logging/observability.
